      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm starting my journey down the web development path. This is my first website of countless more to come...</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Finland but have lived in the US for over three decades.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy disc golf, being outside and making/building things when I'm not in front of a keyboard. Oh, and sometimes I draw and paint things - anyone need a pet portrait?</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Any jobs that are challenging are more interesting to me. I think web development definitely fits that bill. I also enjoy anything with a creative element.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Charlotte, NC.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I like a good mental and creative challenge and enjoy coming up with solutions to them. I believe web development hits on both of those challenges for me.</p>
